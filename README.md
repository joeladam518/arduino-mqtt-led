# arduino-mqtt-led
Leds controlled by mqtt with arduino. Based off of the examples from <https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient>

## Up Next...
* Proto-multithreading so I can run a rgb rainbow loop <https://github.com/ivanseidel/ArduinoThread>
* Installing <https://github.com/dersimn/ArduinoPubSubClientTools> to make it easier to work with pubsubclient.
* Parsing small json strings <https://arduinojson.org/v5/example/parser/> maybe... If I have enough room...

## Notes
* [PubSubClient Docs](https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net/)
